# Accessible slider in vanilla js
That is it at the moment. Its a hobby project. It doesn't even has a name yet.

Feel free to do whatever you want with the code


##todo
 - progressive enhancement
    - normal `input[type=number]` with min, max attributes
 - support for snap points
 - plugin style 
 
 
##issues
 - its hard to drag to the absolute end
 - <kbd>pageup</kbd> increment wont go further if next increment exceeds max even when knob is not at max. same for <kbd>pagedown</kbd> only the other way round
